Given two strings,  and , that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make  and  anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.
For example, if  and , we can delete  from string  and  from string  so that both remaining strings are  and  which are anagrams.

Explanation
We delete the following characters from our two strings to turn them into anagrams of each other
