# Bad number algorithm 
Given array of badNumbers, upper and lower integers, find the maximum number of segments of that array, which does not contain bad numbers.
For example: badNumbers = [5 ,7, 14, 2 , 22, 6 , 29, 19], upper = 20, lower = 3
The method should return 6 ,because (8,13) is the longest segment
Explanation :
We can generate these segments: (3,4), (8,13) ,(15,18), (20,20)

# Winners 
Given two arrays, which contain string (Classmates array is sorted), return integers array which show the absence of each student in 1 and 0 array.
For example : 
Winners = "Isam, Nidal, Mohammed" # Not sorted
Classmates = "Ali , Ahmad, Anan, Mohammed, Nidal" #Sorted
In this case the method should return array of : [0, 1 ,1]
Explanation : Isam is a winner, but he is not exist in the classmates so we put zero.
Nidal and Mohammed is existed, so we put 1.
Keep in mind that the returned array should ordered by the same order of winners array.

# Max pairs
Given Two arrays, a and b , find the maximum number between a[i] and b[i] and return an array, which include the maximum by the same order.
For Example: a = [1,5,6,8], b =[3,3,3,9] , the method should return [3,5,6,9] 
Explanation: (1,3) = 3 \\ (5,3) = 5 \\ (6,3) = 6 \\ (8,9) = 9 
Attention: in some cases, if an array is shorter than the second one, assume that the smallest is containing zeros.
For example : a = [1,6,9] , b = [2,1]
The method should return [2, 6, 9], we assumed that 9 is compared to 0, since b[3] is not existed.

# Array anagrams
Given two arrays, each one is contain strings, return an array of integers which return a number of similar letters.
For Example: arr1 = ["tea", "eat", "simple"] , arr2 = ["tea", "at", "for"]
The output should be an array of integers: [3, 2, 0]
Since "tea", "tea" is identical two each other we return 3 
"eat", "at" at is anagram of two letters so we return 2
"simple", "for" is different from each other so we return 0
# This was the hardest question!

#Sequence array -- if number>5 && mod(3,number) == 2
Given array of integer numbers, which is in mathmatical sequence, return 0 and 1 array if the number exist in that sequence, keep in mind that the sequence starts from 5 and we do not know when it end, and each number is bigger than the latest number by 3.
This is the array : [5,8,11,14,17,21 ....., n], this sequence is not immutable.
Which means in this question this array is not changing, it start from 5 and keep increasing by 3 for each element in the array.
for example: input is [1,7,11,24,27,8], the output should be : [0,0,1,1,1,0]
Since 1, 7, 8 is not in this sequence we return 0
11,24,27 is in the sequence [5,8,11,14,17,21 .....,n ] so we return 1 

# Note: I writed all the questions as i could remember, i have a sharp memory but i cant guarentee ANYTHING.
# So maybe would be some little changes in the real exam, but as far i can tell you if you train on these question you will ace the exam pretty well
#Good Luck!
