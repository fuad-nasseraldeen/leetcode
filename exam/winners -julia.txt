# Winners 
Given two arrays, which contain string (Classmates array is sorted), return integers array which show the absence of each student in 1 and 0 array.
For example : 
Winners = "Isam, Nidal, Mohammed" # Not sorted
Classmates = "Ali , Ahmad, Anan, Mohammed, Nidal" #Sorted
In this case the method should return array of : [0, 1 ,1]
Explanation : Isam is a winner, but he is not exist in the classmates so we put zero.
Nidal and Mohammed is existed, so we put 1.
Keep in mind that the returned array should ordered by the same order of winners array.



function win(classMates , winners)
    d = Dict{String,Int64}()
    #res = Array{Int64}(undef,length(winners))
    res = Int.(zeros(length(winners)))
    for i in classMates
        d[i] = get(d,i,0) 
    end
    for i=1:length(winners)
        if haskey(d,winners[i])
            res[i] = 1
        end
    end
    return res
    println(d)
end
classMates = ["ahmed" , "fuad" , "hesen" , "amjed" , "najeh" , "alex" , "fareed" , "sami" , "Jood"]
winners = ["fuad" , "amjed" , "alex" ,"sobhi" , "fareed"]
println(win(classMates,winners))
